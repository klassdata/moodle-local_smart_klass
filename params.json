Login as an admin and go to *Administration \\> Site administration \\> Plugins \\> Install plugins.\r\n\r\n2.  Click the button 'Install plugins from Moodle plugins directory'.\r\n\r\n3.  Search in moodle.org for the SmartKlass extension with the “Install”\r\n    button (so you can be sure that it will be compatible with your\r\n    *Moodle* version). Click the Install button then click Continue.\r\n\r\n4.  Check that you obtain a 'Validation passed!' message, then click the\r\n    button 'Install plugin'.\r\n\r\n5.  Follow the instructions on your screen.\r\n\r\n### Installing via uploaded ZIP file\r\n\r\n1.  Go to the [*Moodle SmartKlass plugin*](https://moodle.org/plugins/edit.php?plugin=local_smart_klass)\r\n2.  Select your current Moodle version (2.5+ or above), then choose the\r\n    SmartKlass plugin, click Download and download the ZIP file\r\n3.  Login to your Moodle site as an admin and go to Administration \\> Site administration \\> Plugins \\> Install plugins.\r\n4.  Upload the ZIP file and select the appropriate plugin type (local),\r\n5.  Tick the acknowledgement checkbox, then click the button 'Install\r\n    plugin from the ZIP file'.\r\n6.  Check that you obtain a 'Validation passed!' message, then click the\r\n    button 'Install plugin'.\r\n7.  Follow the instructions on your screen.\r\n\r\nMoodle versions before 2.5+\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you can't deploy the plugin code via the administration web interface\r\nas explained above, you have to copy the plugin to the server file\r\nsystem manually (e.g. if the web server process does not have write\r\naccess to the Moodle installation tree to do this for you or if your\r\n*Moodle* version is older than 2.5+).\r\n\r\n1.  Go to the [*Moodle SmartKlass plugin*](https://moodle.org/plugins/edit.php?plugin=local_smart_klass)\r\n2.  Select your current Moodle version (2.4 or above), then choose the\r\n    SmartKlass plugin, click Download and download the ZIP file.\r\n3.  Upload or copy it to your Moodle server.\r\n4.  Unzip it in the right place for the plugin:\r\n\r\n> */path/to/moodle/**local**/*\r\n> A new location will appear: /path/to/moodle/**local/SmartKlass**\r\n\r\n5.  In your Moodle site (as admin) go to *Settings \\> Site administration \\> Notifications*\r\n\r\nYou should get a message saying the plugin is installed.\r\n\r\nWhen installing manually:\r\n\r\n-   Check the file permissions. The web server needs to be able to read\r\n    the plugin files. If the the rest of Moodle works then try to make\r\n    the plugin permissions and ownership match. \r\n    Configure the permissions for all the files and installed code trees\r\n    with your preferred FTP client or your web host dashboard. (e.g. change\r\n    */moodle/local/SmartKlass* to 755 and check if it works).\r\n\r\n-   Did you definitely unzip or install the plugin in the correct place?\r\n    SmartKlass plugin should be unzipped in: */path/to/moodle/local/SmartKlass*\r\n    Where */path/to/moodle/* is the root code tree in your server.\r\n\r\n-   Because Moodle scans plugin folders for new plugins you cannot have\r\n    any other files or folders there. Make sure you deleted the zip file\r\n    and don't try to rename (for example) an old version of the plugin\r\n    to some other name - it will break.\r\n\r\n-   Make sure the directory name for the plugin is correct. All the\r\n    names have to match. If you change the name then it won't work.\r\n    The name for the plugin directory should be called **SmartKlass** and\r\n    should be included in *local*.\r\n\r\nConfiguring\r\n===========\r\n\r\nSmartKlass plugin uses the Cron process in *Moodle.* You should follow\r\nthe setting up instructions from Cron at\r\n[*https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Cron*](https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Cron)\r\n\r\nNote: Do not skip setting up the cron process on your server for your\r\nMoodle. SmartKlass plugin will not work properly without it.\r\n\r\nUpdating\r\n========\r\n\r\nIn *Moodle* 2.4 onwards, you can enable the automatic updates\r\nnotification in:\r\n\r\n*Administration\\> Site Administration \\> Server \\> Update notifications*\r\n\r\nIf the automatic check for available updates is enabled and there is a\r\nnew update available for SmartKlass, a notification will be sent to all\r\nsite admins via email and/or popup message (according to the admin's\r\nmessaging preferences in their profile settings).\r\n\r\n*Install this update* button will be shown on the [Plugins\r\noverview](https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Plugins_overview) page:\r\n\r\n*Settings \\> Site Administration \\> Plugins \\>* [*Plugins\r\noverview*](https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Installing_plugins)*. *\r\n\r\nAn admin can also check for available updates using the 'Check for\r\navailable updates' button in this same [Plugins\r\noverview](https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Plugins_overview) page.\r\n\r\nAny updates available are highlighted, with further information and a\r\ndownload link in the notes column opposite the plugin.\r\n\r\nUninstalling\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo uninstall the plugin:\r\n\r\n1.  Go to *Administration\\> Site Administration \\> Plugins \\> Plugins* *overview*\r\n    and click the Uninstall link opposite the plugin you wish to remove.\r\n\r\n2.  Use a file manager to remove/delete the actual plugin directory\r\n    (/path/to/moodle/**local/SmartKlass**) as instructed, otherwise\r\n    Moodle will reinstall it next time you access the site\r\n    administration.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
